# CODECRAFT Data Science Internship - Task 01

## 📌 Objective
To create a bar chart and histogram to visualize the distribution of population using the World Bank dataset.

---

## 📂 Dataset

## 📊 Steps Performed
1. Loaded the dataset
2. Cleaned the data
3. Selected relevant columns (Country Name & 2022 population)
4. Removed missing values
5. Created a bar chart (Top 10 populated countries)
6. Created a histogram (Population distribution)

## 📈 Visualizations

### 1️⃣ Bar Chart – Top 10 Countries by Population (2022)
Shows the countries with highest population.

### 2️⃣ Histogram – Population Distribution
Shows how population values are distributed across countries.

---

## 📌 Conclusion
